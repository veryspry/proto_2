Notes


SESSIONS

	1. we can use sessions to help track logins

	2. secret - secret session cookie is signed with this secret to prevent tampering

	3. resave: true - forces session to be saved in the session store wether anything changed or not

	4.   saveUninitialized: false - forces an unititialized session in the session store. (this is a new & unmodified session) we don't want to save so we set to false

	5.  store: new MongoStore({ mongooseConnection: db }) - connect the sessions to mongo 



Grabbing data from the request to store in database

	1. we can give each input field a name attribute and call it what we like

	2. we can access this by using the request object *** request.body.[name that you used] ***
